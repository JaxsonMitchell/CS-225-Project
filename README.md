# CS-225-Project
## Overview
This repository is a simplified text-based DND campaign for our Computer Science II course (CS 225) created by Zoe Marowek, Thomas Meyers, and Jaxson Mitchell. To run the code, you run from main which will call the campaign. 

## Style Guide
Here are a few necessary guides that are followed in the project.
* Function and variable names will be camel-cased.
* Classes adhere to Pascal casing.
* In every function implementation, there is a function header describing the inputs and outputs.
* In every class implementation, there is a class header describing the overview of the class.
* There is a file header at the top of every file giving a basic description of the file as a whole.
* Header files (.h) don't contain function implementation and will be in a separate C++ (.cpp) source file. They only contain class and function headers.
*
