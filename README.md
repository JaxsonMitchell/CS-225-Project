# CS-225-Project
## Overview
This repository is a simplified text-based DND campaign for our Computer Science II course (CS 225) created by Zoe Marowek, Thomas Meyers, and Jaxson Mitchell. To run the code, you run from main which will call the campaign. Our game utilizes object-oriented programing that is organized through vectors. Each object has its own unique class that all inherits from a common parent class.

## Style Guide
Here are a few necessary guides that are followed in the project.
* Function and variable names will be camel-cased.
* Classes adhere to Pascal casing.
* There is a file header at the top of every file giving a basic description of the file as a whole as well as the name of the file.
* Comments are used as breaks between implementations within code to compartmentalize the code better allowing for better organization of the code.
* Comments may add extra clutter to code, so the code itself should explain what is happening through good naming style.
** Keep comments sparse
** Allow function names and variable names be clear enough to explain what is happening.
* Header files (.h) don't contain function implementation and will be in a separate C++ (.cpp) source file. They only contain class and function headers.
